# Simporter Test Task

### Small Flask API that provides data for visualisation
Letâ€™s suppose we have a number of events that are distributed in time. Each event has several
attributes. And we have a service (webpage) which purpose is to visualize this distribution (i.e.
show a timeline) using different filters. API returns JSON with data required to provide visualization.
